# Java Concepts: Threads
A simple showcase of threading in Java
## What
Multithreading is one of the key strengths of Java as programmig language.  
As opposed to a process which hogs a memory block until it is finished,  
a thread frees blocks as soon as they are not required.  
Threading is what powers the concurrency of applcation procedures. 
## Who
Threading is considered to one of the advanced topics in Java.  
Hence this repo is a handy reference to those with Java experience. 
However, if you are a beginner with a grasp of the basic concepts,  
read the following and then revisit the repo. It will make much more sense. :)
